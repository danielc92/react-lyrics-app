# React Lyrics App
Developing a Lyrics application using React, musicmatch, axios, gh-pages and Bulma CSS framework. Using Traversy Media Tutorials as a baseline.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Concepts
Intermediate level of React required for this project.

- Using the `Context API` to achieve global component state
- Consumer and Provider concepts
- Using third part external API (`musixmatch`) with `axios`

# Tests 
- Logging response data from API call with axios
- Rendering Top 10 Tracks from global state
- `Consumer` and `Provider` components working
